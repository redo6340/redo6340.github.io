        <h1><strong>Immortal Jellyfish </strong><em>(Turritopsis dohrnii)</em></h1>

        <section id="description">
            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>
                The medusa of <em>Turritopsis dohrnii</em> is bell-shaped, with a maximum diameter of about 4.5 millimetres (0.18 in) and is about as tall as it is wide.
                The mesoglea in the walls of the bell is uniformly thin, except for some thickening at the apex. The relatively large stomach is bright red and 
                has a cruciform shape in cross section. Young specimens 1 mm in diameter have only eight tentacles evenly spaced out along the edge,[14] whereas 
                adult specimens have 80â€“90 tentacles. The medusa (jellyfish) is free-living in the plankton. Dense nerve net cells are also present in the epidermis 
                in the cap. They form a large ring-like structure above the radial canal commonly presented in cnidarians. <em>Turritopsis dohrnii</em> also has a bottom-living
                polyp form, or hydroid, which consists of stolons that run along the substrate and upright branches with feeding polyps that can produce medusa buds.[16]
                These polyps develop over a few days into tiny 1 mm medusae, which are liberated and swim free from the parent hydroid colony.

                <dd>Until a recent genetic study, it was thought that <em>Turritopsis rubra</em> and <em>Turritopsis nutricula</em> were the same.[11] It is not known whether 
                    or not T. rubra medusae can also transform back into polyps.</dd>

            <h2>Distribution and Invasion</h2>
            <p>
                <em>Turritopsis</em> is believed to have originated in the Pacific, but has spread all over the world through trans-Arctic migrations, and has speciated into
                several populations that are easy to distinguish morphologically, but whose species distinctions have recently been verified by a study and comparison 
                of mitochondrial ribosomal gene sequences.[11][17] <em>Turritopsis</em> are found in temperate to tropical regions in all of the world's oceans.[13] <em>Turritopsis</em>
                is believed to be spreading across the world through ballast water discharge.[13] Unlike other species invasions which caused serious economic and 
                ecological consequences, <em>T. dohrnii's</em> invasion around the world was unnoticed due to their tiny size and innocuity.[18] "We are looking at a worldwide
                silent invasion", said Smithsonian Tropical Marine Institute scientist Dr. Maria Miglietta.[17]

        <section id="Biological Immortality">
            <h2>Biological Immortality</h2>
            <p>
                Most jellyfish species have a relatively fixed lifespan, which varies by species from hours to many months (long-lived mature jellyfish spawn every day or night;
                the time is also fairly fixed and species-specific).[20] The medusa of <em>Turritopsis dohrnii</em> is the only form known to have developed the ability to return to a polyp
                state, by a specific transformation process that requires the presence of certain cell types (tissue from both the jellyfish bell surface and the circulatory canal system).[21]
            <p>
                Experiments have revealed that all stages of the medusae, from newly released to fully mature individuals, can transform back into polyps under the conditions of starvation, 
                sudden temperature change, reduction of salinity, and artificial damage of the bell with forceps or scissors.
            </p>
               <dl>
                <dd>[3] The transforming medusa is characterized first by deterioration of the bell, mesoglea, and tentacles. All immature medusa (with 12 tentacles at most) then turned into a 
                    cyst-like stage and then transformed into stolons and polyps. However, about 20%-40% of mature medusa went into the stolons and polyps stage without passing the cyst-like stage.
                    Polyps were formed after 2 days since stolons had developed and fed on food. Polyps further multiply by growing additional stolons, branches, and then polyps to form colonial 
                    hydroids. In the experiment, they would eventually transform into stolons and polyps and begin their lives once again, even without environmental changes or injury.<dd>

                [3]This ability to reverse the biotic cycle (in response to adverse conditions)is unique in the animal kingdom. It allows the jellyfish to bypass death, rendering Turritopsis 
                dohrnii potentially biologically immortal. The process has not been observed in their natural habitat, in part because the process is quite rapid and because field observations
                at the right moment are unlikely.[3] Regardless, most individual medusae are likely to fall victim to the general hazards of life as mesoplankton, including being eaten by predators
                or succumbing to disease.The species' cell development method of transdifferentiation has inspired scientists to find a way to make stem cells using this process for renewing damaged 
                or dead tissue in humans.[10]
