        <h1>About</h1> 
        <img src="/img/waterfall.jpg">
        <p>I am currently a second-year student at the University of Colorado at Boulder. I am on track to receive a Bachelor of Science degree in Strategic Communication-narrowing my focus on Public Relations. I am also receiving a minor in Creative Technology and Design alongside my bachelor's degree.

            While at CU, I have been able to explore all aspects of creativity within strategic communication. During group projects, I have experienced the limitless benefits of collaborative effort alongside my peers. I enjoy learning about the nature of strategy as well as its importance in the realm of brand communication. Challenge is always available, and it has pushed me to become an ambitious individual who is ready to contribute my strengths to the communications world. I am an active member of the Public Relations Student Society of America, which has brought many beneficial tools that mentor us for professional agencies. I am also a volunteer for the university's center of restorative justice. I highly value the chance to be able to connect with other students and reintroduce them into the community.
